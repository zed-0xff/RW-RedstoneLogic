  <description><![CDATA[<color=#1a8bff><b>Redstone Logic</b></color>

Requires research. Prerequisite: stonecutting.
Not official Minecraft product. Not approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Redstone dust</b></color>

A mysterious glowing mineral from a parallel universe. An essential component of all redstone-operated mechanisms.
Obtaining:
- small lumps of redstone ore will be generated on new maps
- Ground-penetrating scanner will find lumps of buried redstone on existing maps
- trade caravans
- quest rewards
- redstone mining worksites (Ideology)

<color=#1a8bff><b>Redstone wire</b></color>

Similar to electric conduit, redstone wire transmits redstone power.
Power level drops by 1 for every cell of redstone wire.
Thus, redstone wire can transmit power for no more than 15 cells. 

<color=#1a8bff><b>Generators</b></color>

  • Redstone Torch - generates signal of level 15, cannot be moved, never burns out
  • Redstone Block - generates signal of level 15, can me moved, can be pushed by pistons
  • Lever - generates signal of level 15 when switched on, cannot be moved

<color=#1a8bff><b>Daylight Detector</b></color>

Produces redstone power in proportion to the daylight cycle. Can be switched to moonlight mode. Is not affected by roofs or artificial light sources.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Tripwire Hook</b></color>

Emits a redstone signal when any pawn or item appears between two hooks.
One hook can have up to 4 links.
Floor-level buildings, like pressure plates, will not trigger the hook.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Pressure plates</b></color>

Wooden pressure plates can detect all entities.
Stone pressure plates can detect only pawns/animals.
Golden ("Light") detect all entities, and the signal strength equals the number of entities stood on one.
Steel ("Heavy") is similar to golden, but measures groups of 10 entities.

<color=#1a8bff><b>TNT</b></color>

An explosive block with logic pretty similar to minecraft's one.
Can be ignited by redstone signal, fire or explosion.
Best combined with tripwires or pressure plates :)

<color=#1a8bff><b>Repeater</b></color>

Repeats incoming signal with a configurable 1..250 ticks delay.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Comparator</b></color>

A redstone comparator is a block that can produce an output signal from its front by reading chests, lecterns, beehives and similar blocks, or repeat a signal without changing its strength. It can also be set to either stop outputting a signal when its side input recieves a stronger one (front torch off), or subtract its side input's signal strength from its output (front torch on).

<color=#1a8bff><b>Block</b></color>

Just a simple stuffable block that can be pushed by pistons. Think of it as a movable wall.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Piston and sticky piston</b></color>

Piston:
- pushes any items into an empty cell
- pushes acceptable items into a storage
- breaks any plants/trees, producing harvested resources, if any
- pushes pawns
- if pawns are pushed against the wall, they receive blunt damage
- pushes blocks
- pushes other pistons if they're not extended
Sticky piston:
- pushes all things similar to a regular one
- pulls blocks / pistons back
By default pistons will not push or pull most of vanilla buildings. I've added example support to vanilla torch lamp, campfire and
low pod, which will be just breaked by a piston.

<color=#1a8bff><b>Extending</b></color>
If building is simple and does not have any caching logic in postspawn(), then this should be sufficient:
<modExtensions>
  <li Class="RedstoneLogic.ExtPistonMoveable"/>
</modExtensions>
If you want building to break when pushed by a piston:
<modExtensions>
  <li Class="RedstoneLogic.ExtPistonMoveable">
    <breaks>true</breaks>
  </li>
</modExtensions>
If building has some internal logic/caching, and just changing it's position is not sufficient: (true for all storage buildings)
<modExtensions>
  <li Class="RedstoneLogic.ExtPistonMoveable">
    <respawn>true</respawn>
  </li>
</modExtensions>
